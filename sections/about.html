                                    We have a saboteur aboard. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. My
                                    oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or
                                    do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur,
                                    wholeheartedly! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us,
                                    human history would be far less bloody. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Mr.
                                    Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. When has justice ever been as simple as a
                                    rule book? Computer, belay that order. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian
                                    canapés?
                                    Are you up for promotion? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not
                                    insane. Besides, you look good in a dress. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.
                                    That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. For an android
                                    with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. I am your worst nightmare! Some days
                                    you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. A lot of things can change in twelve years,
                                    Admiral. Computer, lights up! I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer.
                                    And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath
                                    of loyalty to Starfleet.
                                    I'll be sure to note that in my log. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir.
                                    Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little
                                    frayed on the ship lately? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Mr. Worf, you sound like a
                                    man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. You're going to be an interesting
                                    companion, Mr. Data. Your shields were failing, sir. When has justice ever been as simple as a
                                    rule book? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Smooth
                                    as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Some days you get the
                                    bear, and some days the bear gets you.
                                    Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history
                                    would be far less bloody. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night -
                                    'Commander'? How long can two people talk about nothing? Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire
                                    phasers? The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Congratulations - you just destroyed the
                                    Enterprise. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going
                                    to want a full investigation. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the
                                    ship.
